### Hi there! 👋

My name is Justin and I am currently working to become a software developer. I've always had a strong passion for technology and have decided to take action and pursue a career as a software developer. I have experience in Java, C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and HTML5/CSS. I'm currently learning how to utilize ThreeJS and cloud based platforms, and am very interested in expanding my knowledge with different programming languages!

### Projects 🖥️
If you are interested in any of my work, please check out my pinned projects as they are currently a good demonstration of my programming ability.
My current live sites deployed are:
- [3D Sudoku App Built using ThreeJS and React](https://3js-sudoku.vercel.app/)
- [Sudoku App Built using Next.JS](https://next-sudoku-ebon.vercel.app/)
- [Interactive Three JS App](https://3js-skull.vercel.app/)
