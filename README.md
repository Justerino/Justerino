### Hi there! 👋

My name is Justin and I am currently working to become a software developer. I've always had a strong passion for technology and have decided to take action and pursue a career as a software developer. I have light experience in Java, C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and HTML5/CSS. I'm currently learning how to utilize Golang and Rust, and am very interested in expanding my knowledge with different programming languages! I'm looking to collaborate with open source projects to help contribute to the github community and learn as much as I can. 

### Projects 🖥️
If you are interested in any of my work, please check out my pinned projects as they are currently a good demonstration of my programming ability.
